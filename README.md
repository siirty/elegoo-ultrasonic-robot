# elegoo-ultrasonic-robot

## Robot
This will be a simple projekt for the [Elegoo Smart Robot'- kit](https://www.elegoo.com/collections/uno-r3-starter-kits/products/elegoo-smart-robot-car-kit-v-3-0-plus) version 1.0 .
The robot is fitted with an IR and an ultrasonic sensor, the latter is mounted on a servo an can be rotated around the z -axis. With the IR sensor a simple control can be implemented over a standard IR remote.
Each side of the robot is controled independently for steering.

## Goals
Implementing all basic functions of the robots to refresh my C -knowledge. Later expand the functions with a sekf made RTOS.
